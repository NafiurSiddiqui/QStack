# QStack 

This is an app that help you archive your favourite quotes. This was a course project after going through the react-router concepts originally and I enhanced some features and functionalities.

## Things I have learned to work with from this app

- BrowserRouter
- Routers and Route
- Nested routes
- dynamic routing
- outlet
- navlink
- useNavigate
- userParams
- complex http hook and api


## Things I have added by myself

- This course was built on react-router-dom@5. I have used and implemented all the features of react-router-dom@6 by myself.

- Added form validation and associated stylings.

- Added github CI ( Continous Integration ) with Firebasae to automate things removing redundancy.
